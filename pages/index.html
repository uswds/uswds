      <h2>How to Create A Digital Service Acquisition</h2>
      <h3 class="usa-font-lead">Okay, before we start building your Request for Quote (RFQ), let's get an estimate. Currently we offer two methods. The first, App Estimator, will help you estimate the cost and rescources associated with building a single app. The Second, Agile Estimator will help you build an estimate for what we call "agile in a box" (i.e., an iterative development team).
        </h3>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h2>Tools</h2>
<p>If you are looking to build an app, let's start here:</p>
<p><div><FORM>
<INPUT TYPE="button" VALUE="App Estimator" onClick="parent.location='https://pre-award.herokuapp.com/'">
</FORM>
</div></p>

<p>If you need ongoing development services or are looking to build a series of capabilities click the button below:</p>
<p><div><FORM>
<INPUT TYPE="button" VALUE="Agile Estimator" onClick="parent.location='https://acquisition-planning-beta.herokuapp.com/agile_estimator'">

In addition to the applications above you can check out the [GSA Contract Awarded Labor Category (CALC)](https://calc.gsa.gov/) tool.


<strong>Looks like you are ready to start building your Digital Service Acquisition, that's great!</strong> Click on the Req Builder  button below to get started. This is still a beta version so it is limited to the recomended Fixed Price per Iteration model.
