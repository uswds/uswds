# Welcome!

We're so glad you're thinking about contributing to an 18F open source project! If you're unsure about anything, just ask — or submit the issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is you'll be politely asked to change something. We appreciate all friendly contributions.

We want to ensure a welcoming environment for all of our projects. Our staff follows the [18F Code of Conduct](https://github.com/18F/code-of-conduct/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md) and all contributors should do the same.

We encourage you to read this project's CONTRIBUTING policy (you are here), its [LICENSE](LICENSE.md), and its [README](README.md). 

If you have any questions or want to read more, check out the [18F Open Source Policy GitHub repository]( https://github.com/18f/open-source-policy), or just [shoot us an email](mailto:18f@gsa.gov).
