lead: "U.S. government websites have common typographic needs: clear and consistent headings, highly legible body paragraphs, clear labels, and easy-to-use input fields. We recommend a font system that uses two open-source font families: Source Sans Pro and Merriweather, both of which are designed for legibility and can beautifully adapt to a variety of visual styles."
