<h4 class="usa-heading-alt">Merriweather</h4>

<div class="usa-grid-full">
  <div class="usa-width-one-half">
    <p>Merriweather is an open-source serif typeface designed for on-screen reading. This font is ideal for text-dense design: the letterforms have a tall x-height but remain relatively small, making for excellent readability across screen sizes while not occupying extra horizontal space.</p>
    <p>The combination of slim and thick weights gives the font family stylistic range, while conveying a desirable mix of classic, yet modern simplicity. Merriweather communicates warmth and credibility at both large and smaller font sizes.</p>
